Web Project for Web Development Class

## Introduction:
Hello! Welcome to my documentation where I talk about my website Code Green! This website was built to be an informative website about the benefits and the positive impact computer science is having towards climate change and other environmental issues while also having images, sources for more information, and a natural-toned aesthetic. Through this website I hope to build more of a positive reputation behind the reasons to go into Computer Science.
