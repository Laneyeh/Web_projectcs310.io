            <h1>Greenhouse Emissions</h1>
            <p id="text">
                An important aspect of Greenhouse Emissions and how computer science benefits from this is Quantum
                Computing,
                which
                could help revolutionize the fight for climate change immensely. Quantum Computers utilizes Quantum
                Physics and
                its
                principles to quickly solve problems that would be impossible for classic computers to solve. This plays
                a big
                factor in
                limiting global warming to the target temperature of 1.5 degrees C which in turn, helps reduce emission.
                But
                since Quantum
                computers are so powerful, they are extremely expensive, but this is something the country has to put a
                LOT of
                money towards
                since the computer holds a lot of power, bytes, and rams.

            <h5>Batteries: </h5>
            Batteries are important in order to achieve zero carbon electrification and can benefit the storage solution
            used in
            the grid scale.

            <h5>Solar Cells:</h5>
            Solar Cells are based off of perovskite crystal structures which is being used as the greater alternative
            with the
            efficiency being
            able to go up to 40%, though brings up challenges including the lack of long term stability and can become
            more
            toxic overtime.
            Solar Cells help solar panels use the energy they collect from the sunlight and transferring it into energy
            that we
            can use on a daily
            basis as an alternative for fossil fuels.

            for Example, using Hydrogen and Ammonia as replacements for Fossil Fuels. Solar Cells are made through
            natural gas
            and allows Co2 to
            be captured directly, which is important because this process collecting Co2 can get expensive.
            </p>
            <p id="conclusion">
            <h4> So... What solutions can come from this???</h4>
            Quantum Computing promises to enable more accurate modeling structure to make effective and new solvents to
            range
            out new Co2 sources.
            This reduces the cost to process from 30% to 50% through direct air capture. This involves literally sucking
            the Co2
            out of the air and
            is a way to address carbon removals
