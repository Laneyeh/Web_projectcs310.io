        With every passing moment, solar panels are becoming more efficient and less exprensive every year, but how can
        we
        derive even more energy from a solar plant working as computer scientists?

        One solution that has been in the works since 1978, is a solar computer. Solar Panels have become capable of
        charging
        computers directly, which helps when charging computers directly which help charge electronics. Some mechanic
        magazines
        in 1978 thought of a do-it-yourself solar energy commputer to combat this issue.The end product would charge the
        battery
        during the day with the battery powering the computer during the night. Though this system could be functional,
        it was not
        as practical or efficient to be used on a daily basis. But these magazines started the ideas around the Solar
        Computer.

        <h2> While solar computers don't exist yet, there are two main methods to run a computer based on solar power
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a home solar power system to charge your electronic devices</li>
            <li>Deriving energy completely from a solar plant</li>
        </ol>
        Through whatever way you make a solar computer, they will need to rely heavily on solar panels as they are BIG
        converters for energy from the sunlight and turning it into electrical energy. Through using solar computers,
        you
        will save money on your electricity bills, you PC will always have power, and you are using energy to power your
        computer rather than fossil fuels.
