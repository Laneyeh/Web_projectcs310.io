                Computers are extremely impactful when it comes to eco-friendly design, since they used to be hand
                drawn.
                Now that computers are here, they can help designs become more executable, be made more efficiently, and
                waste less materials in the meantime. In order to fully understand how computers help: I think it would
                be
                helpful for some background knowledge on environmental research and computers.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Throughout environmental research and design, computers are used to calculate,
                analyze, compare, and scruntinize different research endevors to deepen our
                understanding and create the best project design plan.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Using Drawing/Design software like Adobe Photoshop, 3dsMax, and AutoCAD, environmental in high quality
                and
                expressed in a quick fashion. All 3 of these softwares can create basic graphics with varying pros and
                cons.
                While hardware is always being updated daily, software is updated every so often and based on the needs
                of
                the users. Through these apps, they combine the essential principles of Computer-Aided Design through
                combining.
                Accumulation and artistic accomplishment. While the Computer performs the more intricate tasks with
                handling
                data
                and graphs, the software the computer has already handles the tasks of image editing, resizing, scaling,
                translation,
                and rotation faster.
            </p>
            Through AutoCAD, you can build the basic design of software.

                When it comes to engineering, they identify areas that need improvement and make their designs based off
                of what
                we need the most. For Example, computer models, they can stimulate the energy usage of a building under
                different
                condition, helping architects and engineers to design buildings that minimize energy waster and reduce
                their
                environmental impact. Engineering construction drawings always utilize image electronic equipment and
                computers
                to
                help Designers perform design work, information storage, and undertake calculations. Engineers can
                design solar
                panels
                and turbines to be more efficient and leads to more production of renewable energy production rather
                than using
                more
                fossil fuels. They can optimize energy storage systems even when there is no wind or sun.

                With the changing development of technology and the environment daily: For example, big data, the
                internet, and
                artificial intelligence (otherwise known as AI), these changes can bring a powerful advantage when it
                comes to
                benefitting eco-friendly design. Throughh Eco-Friendly design, computer scientists and the general
                public can
                access information to and learn more about mastering new technologies, creative level and overall
                improve the
                level and diligence of computer-aided design throughout the years.
