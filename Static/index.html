        <div id="description">
          Code Green is an informative website about the benefits of computer scientists
          towards climate and environmental issues while also containing fun designs,
          inforgraphics, and easy to digest information that everyone can understand. It
          also contains the sources I got my information from so users that are interested
          can learn more if they choose so.

        <div id="description">
          I hope that making an informative website about this important issue that it
          would not only make computer scientists feel more secure in their career choice
          and their impact on the environment and the world around them. I hope that this
          will also encourage the study of Computer Science and its so important towards the
          impact of the Earth's future environment.

          that we
          can use on a daily
          basis as an alternative for fossil fuels.

          for Example, using Hydrogen and Ammonia as replacements for Fossil Fuels. Solar Cells are made through
          natural gas

            With every passing moment, solar panels are becoming more efficient and less exprensive every year, but how
            can
            we
            derive even more energy from a solar plant working as computer scientists?

            One solution that has been in the works since 1978, is a solar computer. Solar Panels have become capable of
            charging
            computers directly, which helps when charging computers directly which help charge electronics. Some
            mechanic
            magazines
            in 1978 thought of a do-it-yourself solar energy commputer to combat this issue.The end product would charge
            the
            battery
            during the day with the battery powering the computer during the night. Though this system could be
            functional,
            it was not
            as practical or efficient to be used on a daily basis. But these magazines started the ideas around the
            Solar
            Computer.
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2> While solar computers don't exist yet, there are two main methods to run a computer based on solar power
          </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Using a home solar power system to charge your electronic devices</li>
            <li>Deriving energy completely from a solar plant</li>
          </ol>
          Through whatever way you make a solar computer, they will need to rely heavily on solar panels as they are BIG
          converters for energy from the sunlight and turning it into electrical energy. Through using solar computers,
          you
          will save money on your electricity bills, you PC will always have power, and you are using energy to power
          your
          computer rather than fossil fuels.

        <p>
          Energy is a limiting resource in a world fueled by computers and in order to better climate change through
          computer science, we need a better understanding of energy efficiency.- Energy efficiency refers to the way
          through
          which the growth of energy consumption can be managed and prevented. This is really important knowing the
          rising
          prices of energy and expansion of large data set (big data) processing demand. The challenge of energy
          efficiency
          comes with the opportunity to improve it by getting a detailed analysis of the energy metric
        <p>
        <h4>What is the energy metric?</h4>
        <p>
          a measure or standard for assessing how much energy is being used or consumed by a particular system,
          device, or process.
          It helps you understand and compare the energy efficiency of different things. The metric could be expressed
          in various
          units like watts, joules, or other energy-related units to quantify the amount of energy involved. In
          summary, it tells the user
          how much power something generates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though the measurement of energy efficiency is a challenge because there is no real way to “measure” energy
          some
          studies are trying to show the impact of what could happen if we efficiently use our energy within the
          computer science career.
        </p>
        <h4> Cognitive Radio Systems: </h4>
        <p>
          A cognitive radio is one of many forms of wireless communication devices that can change and adapt based
          on radio frequencies and its environement. This helps with radio and wireless communication and through
          calling and texting, this is something that is used everyday. We are always looking for a more flexible
          and efficient way of communicating with one another and it's no surprise that this uses up a lot of energy.


          Cognitive Radio Systems need to perform the following...
        <ul>
          <li>Data Transmission</li>
          <li>Spectrum Sensing</li>
          <li>Spectrum availability preditction while conserving energy</li>
        </ul>
        this holds the potential to decrease carbon emissions
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3 style="font-family:'Agbalumo',serif;"> Study at Oregon State University</h3>
        The computer science students at Oregon state university had a breakthrough in reducing
        the energy consumption of computer chips specifically used in data centers and super computers.
        This helps greatly because a data center could consume up to 50 times more energy per square foot of
        floor space more than a typical office building. The study was supported by the U.S national
        Science foundation. When modifying the hardware inside of a computer, it can cut the energy consumed,
        which is what helped them find success in their study.
        </p>

        <p>
          If we can find a way for computers to use less energy efficiency, this could lead to laptops and other
          electronics being smaller and lighter, perform complicated calculations, unprecedented speed, and
          especially,
          generate less heat, which will benefit out environment.
