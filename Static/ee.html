            Energy is a limiting resource in a world fueled by computers and in order to better climate change through
            computer science, we need a better understanding of energy efficiency.- Energy efficiency refers to the way
            through
            which the growth of energy consumption can be managed and prevented. This is really important knowing the
            rising
            prices of energy and expansion of large data set (big data) processing demand. The challenge of energy
            efficiency
            comes with the opportunity to improve it by getting a detailed analysis of the energy metric
        </div>
        <div id="text">
            <h3>What is the energy metric?</h3>
            a measure or standard for assessing how much energy is being used or consumed by a particular system,
            device, or process.
            It helps you understand and compare the energy efficiency of different things. The metric could be expressed
            in various
            units like watts, joules, or other energy-related units to quantify the amount of energy involved. In
            summary, it tells the user
            how much power something generates.
        </div>
        <div id="text">
            Though the measurement of energy efficiency is a challenge because there is no real way to “measure” energy
            some
            studies are trying to show the impact of what could happen if we efficiently use our energy within the
            computer science career.

            <h3> Cognitive Radio Systems: </h3>
            A cognitive radio is one of many forms of wireless communication devices that can change and adapt based
            on radio frequencies and its environement. This helps with radio and wireless communication and through
            calling and texting, this is something that is used everyday. We are always looking for a more flexible
            and efficient way of communicating with one another and it's no surprise that this uses up a lot of energy.


            Cognitive Radio Systems need to perform the following...
            <ul>
                <li>Data Transmission</li>
                <li>Spectrum Sensing</li>
                <li>Spectrum availability preditction while conserving energy</li>
            </ul>
            this holds the potential to decrease carbon emissions

            <h3> Study at Oregon State University</h3>
            The computer science students at Oregon state university had a breakthrough in reducing
            the energy consumption of computer chips specifically used in data centers and super computers.
            This helps greatly because a data center could consume up to 50 times more energy per square foot of
            floor space more than a typical office building. The study was supported by the U.S national
            Science foundation. When modifying the hardware inside of a computer, it can cut the energy consumed,
            which is what helped them find success in their study.
        </div>

        <div id="conclusion">
            If we can find a way for computers to use less energy efficiency, this could lead to laptops and other
            electronics being smaller and lighter, perform complicated calculations, unprecedented speed, and
            especially,
            generate less heat, which will benefit out environment.
